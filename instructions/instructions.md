HubTrack PRD (Product Requirements Document)

# Project Overview

HubTrack by BioGreen360 is a food waste tracking platform designed for use in commercial kitchens. It captures weight, feed type, and user data via an interactive cart with a touchscreen interface and uploads the data to a cloud backend. It supports offline functionality and includes robust features for onboarding, auditing, system setup, and analytics.

# Core Functional Goals

Track food waste entries with weight, image, user, and feed type

Sync collected data to MongoDB Atlas when online

Store images in S3 and link them in MongoDB

Allow for local-only use with deferred sync

Provide multilingual, visual user experience

Enable easy commissioning and setup of carts

Audit and manage available feed types per site

Handle software updates, offline storage, and long-term scale

# Tech Stack

## Hardware

Load Cell + Amplifier (0–10V or 4–20mA)

USB DAQ: LabJack U3

USB Webcam

Touchscreen PC: Windows-based (OnLogic or similar)

## Software

Frontend: Electron app

Backend: Node.js with Python helpers

Database: MongoDB Atlas (with local MongoDB mirror)

Image Storage: Amazon S3

Deployment:  Electron app with auto-updater for version management

Data Flow Summary

User logs in with PIN

Places food waste bin on scale

System records weight from DAQ

User selects feed type

System takes a picture with USB webcam

Data written to local MongoDB with sync flags

Image saved locally and uploaded to S3 when online
